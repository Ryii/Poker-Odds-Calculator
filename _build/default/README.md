└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The interface shows equity distribution and provides actionable recommendations based on pot odds analysis.

### Technical Implementation

**Hand Evaluation Algorithm**

```ocaml
(* Bitwise magic for 7-card evaluation *)
let evaluate_7cards cards =
  let hearts = (c1 land 0x1000) lor (c2 land 0x1000) lor ... in
  if popcount hearts >= 5 then
    flush_ranks.(hearts lsr 16)
  else
    non_flush_ranks.(perfect_hash cards)
```

**Monte Carlo Simulation**

```ocaml
let calculate_equity ~hero_hand ~villain_range ~board ~iterations =
  (* Monte Carlo simulation with optimized sampling *)
  for _ = 1 to iterations do
    let villain = sample_from_range villain_range in
    let runout = sample_remaining_cards board in
    update_statistics (evaluate hero villain runout)
  done
```

**Graphics Engine**

- OCaml Graphics library for cross-platform rendering
- Event-driven interface with mouse and keyboard input
- Real-time visualization updates
- Optimized redraw cycle for smooth performance
